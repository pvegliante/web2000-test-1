6. Use browserify to bundle all the files in the following project: https://github.com/Swolebrain/connect4
Setup Steps:

Fork the project by going to the above link and clicking "Fork" near the top right of the screen
The project will now have a copy in your own github page. Clone it from there.
In your computer, initialize this folder as a node project.
Install browserify, make sure it's saved as a development dependency in package.json
Split out the code from the createTable function and the isLegitEdge function into separate files. Make sure each function has its own file.
Back in your main file, require the contents of your two new files
Create an npm script to use browserify to create a javascript bundle (one single file containing all your JS).
Do anything else you need to do in order to get the bundle working and test your site.
Before submitting, ensure your code is browserified. If the first line is not a long, minified function then you did it wrong.
Commit and push to github
Upload the game to yourname.fvi-grad.com
Bonus points: Produce a minified bundle for the exercise above using uglifyjs.
